# 💬 Real-Time Chat with Socket.IO

An exciting real-time chat project using **Socket.IO**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**.

---

## 📄 Project Description

This project is a basic implementation of a real-time chat system. Although simple, it was a valuable learning experience where I explored:

- Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional communication
- Express.js for building the backend server
- TypeScript for stronger typing and cleaner code

There are still some improvements and minor bug fixes to be made, but the **core structure and functionality are working well**.

## 📡 What is Socket.IO?

**Socket.IO** is an event-driven JavaScript library for real-time web applications.  
It enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

It has two main components:

- A server-side library for Node.js
- A client-side library that runs in the browser

## 🧪 Testing the Chat

1. Open your browser and navigate to:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

2. Open the same URL in a second browser window or a different device.

3. Send a message in one window — it should appear in real-time in both!

🎉 You now have a working real-time chat app!

## 📌 Final Notes

This project is a great starting point for learning how real-time communication works using Socket.IO and how to combine it with Express and TypeScript.
